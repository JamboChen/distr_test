# Goodness of Fit Test for `Rand` crate

This is a demo that tests the distribution of [`rand`](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/index.html) using a [chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test).

Some specific values ​​(e.g. the area under the normal pdf curve) are calculated using R language.
